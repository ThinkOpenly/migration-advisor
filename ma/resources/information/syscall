Syscall not available for Linux on Power checker

Almost all x86 and x86_64 Linux system calls (syscalls) are available for
POWER architecture. Using an x86-specific system call causes problems when
migrating your code to POWER architecture. The syscall not available for
Linux on Power checker analyzes all system calls in your code and displays
a warning for system calls that are not available for 32-bit or 64-bit POWER
architectures.

int main() {
    int rc;
    struct stat64 s;
    char *file = "test_file.txt";
    if ((rc = syscall(SYS_stat64, file, &s)) == -1) {
        printf("Failed to execute syscall with rc = %d (%s)", errno, strerror(errno));
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
}
