Long double usage checker

The use of long double might be a migration problem because of the differences
in size and format between x86 and POWER architecture. With current GCC compilers,
long double is 128 bits (AIXÂ® double double format) for POWER architecture.
Therefore, long double for POWER architecture is in a different format than long
double for x86 ILP32 (96 bits) or x86 ILP64 (binary 128).
