Char usage checker

The use of char might be a problem when assigning a numeric value to a
variable of type char. By default, the char type is signed in x86 but
it is unsigned in POWER architecture. The safe mode to use a char that
receives a numeric value is to declare it as signed or unsigned.

void foo() {
    char c = -1;
    int x = (int) c;
    printf("x = %d\n", x);
    // This prints -1 in x86 machines and 255 in ppc machines.
}
