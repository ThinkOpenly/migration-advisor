Hardware Transaction Memory checker

This checker finds occurrences of x86 hardware transaction memory usage,
which is not supported on POWER architectures. Transactional Synchronization
Extensions (TSX), an x86 instruction set extension, enables hardware
transaction memory support to speed up the execution of multithreaded programs.


#include <rtmintrin.h>
void foo(unsigned int a, unsigned int b){
    while(1){
        unsigned status = _xbegin();
        if(status == XBEGIN_STARTED) {
            trans_func(a, b);
            _xend();
            break;
        }else{
            _xabort();
        }
    }
